#Cloned - Duplicated HEIC JPG Remover
A simple app to detect and delete cloned/duplicated HEIC / JPG images on Mac

Since iOS 11,  iPhone / iPad has been able to take .HEIC images that is much smaller than .JPG (Refer to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207022 for more details)

However, whenever those images are being imported to Mac they are usualy being duplicated result in 2 copies of the same image with the same name but different extension (i.e IMG_0001.HEIC and IMG_0001.JPG), and the .JPG images always have much bigger size than the .HEIC images. I have 10K images in my Macbook and it would take me ages to find and delete those duplicated images, so I created this little tool to do that task quickly with few clicks.

All you need to do is click the Download button above on this page to download it, then unzip and launch the *Cloned - Duplicated HEIC JPG Remover.app*

Select the first option if you want to delete the duplicated JPG images and keep the HEIC ones. I prefer this option because JPG are ways heavier than HEIC and this could help saving me a lot of disk space on my Macbook 's SSD. I was able to reclaim about 30GB of free space after removing all duplicated JPG images, which is a lot. In case you want to delete HEIC images and keep the JPG ones, you can select 2nd option

Next step is to select a folder that contain those images, in this version it only works with *images under the parent folder that you selected*, so if that folder has sub-folders and there are other images in them, those will be skip.

You may need to allow the tool to access your Finder, so that it can be able to find and delete duplicated/cloned images

Once it's done, you will see a pop up showing how many duplicated images have been deleted.

Those deleted images actually are still in your Trash, so you can open it to verify and then empty it once you are sure those are the duplicated images you want to remove
